# Jazz improvisation with LSTM

The goal is to apply an LSTM to music generation and Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.
Here, i will train a RNN on an audio dataset and then Sample jazz music sequences based on the trained model.
I will be using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) that can remember a piece of information and keep it saved for many timesteps.
(This mini-project is a part of Deep Learning specialization course. The dataset, any pre-trained weights/models and Model Architecture used were provided by Coursera.)
